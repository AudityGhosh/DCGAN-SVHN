# DCGAN-SVHN

This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate synthetic images using the SVHN (Street View House Numbers) dataset. The model is trained to generate realistic images based on the training data, and it's implemented in Python using TensorFlow.

## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AudityGhosh/DCGAN-SVHN.git
```

### Set up a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to set up a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts. You can create a new virtual environment with the following command:

#### For Python 3.x:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

#### For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Once the virtual environment is created, activate it:

#### For macOS/Linux:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

#### For Windows:

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies

After activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies. The necessary libraries are listed in the **`requirements.txt`** file. If the project doesn't have a `requirements.txt` file, manually install the required libraries listed below.

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scipy pillow h5py
```

## Usage

1. Open the `DCGAN_SVHN.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Train the DCGAN model.
   - Generate synthetic images.

You can visualize the generated images directly in the notebook as they are produced.
